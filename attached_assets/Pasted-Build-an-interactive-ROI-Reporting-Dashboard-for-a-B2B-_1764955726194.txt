Build an interactive ROI Reporting Dashboard for a B2B SaaS company (SeekOut) that helps Customer Success Managers demonstrate value to clients.

## What to Build
A responsive web dashboard with 3 views:
1. Executive Summary (landing page)
2. Influenced Hires Detail (data table)
3. Adoption Metrics (charts)

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts or Chart.js for visualizations
- Use a modern, professional design (think Tableau/Looker aesthetic)

## Sample Data
Generate realistic mock data for a customer called "Acme Corp":
- ARR: $150,000
- Total Licenses: 25
- Active Users: 22
- 35 influenced hires over 12 months
- Mix of levels: 8 Senior Leadership, 5 Managers, 12 Lead ICs, 10 ICs
- Diversity: 40% Female, 8% African American, 12% Hispanic

## Executive Summary View (Landing Page)
Layout: 4 metric cards at top, 2 charts below, filters in sidebar

### Metric Cards (top row)
1. **Influenced Hires**: 35 (with sparkline trend)
2. **Cost Per Hire**: $4,286 (ARR ÷ hires)
3. **Agency Savings**: $2.1M (sum of salaries × 20%)
4. **SeekOut Value Add**: 2.3% (influenced ÷ total hires)

### Charts
- **Left**: Horizontal bar chart - "Influenced Hires by Level" 
- **Right**: Donut chart - "Diversity Breakdown"

### Filters (sidebar or top)
- Customer dropdown (default: Acme Corp)
- Date range selector (Q1 2024, Q2 2024, etc.)
- Export button (PDF, Excel icons)

## Influenced Hires Detail View
Sortable, filterable data table with columns:
| Name | Title | Level | Location | Hire Date | SeekOut Actions | Diversity |

- **SeekOut Actions**: Show as tags/badges (Exported, Contacted, Added to Project)
- **Diversity**: Show gender/ethnicity badges where applicable
- Include search bar and level filter dropdown
- Pagination (10 per page)

Generate 35 rows of realistic hire data:
- Names like "Sarah Chen", "Michael Rodriguez", "Jennifer Thompson"
- Titles like "Senior Software Engineer", "VP of Engineering", "Data Scientist"
- Locations like "San Francisco, CA", "New York, NY", "Austin, TX"
- Random mix of SeekOut actions per hire

## Adoption Metrics View
Two sections:

### Usage Overview
- Utilization gauge: 88% (22/25 licenses)
- Login frequency: "4.2x per week" with benchmark comparison
- Monthly Active Users line chart (last 6 months)

### Feature Utilization
- Bar chart showing % usage of features:
  - Diversity Filters: 56%
  - SeekOut Assist: 45%
  - Workspaces: 32%

## Design Requirements
- Color scheme: Professional purple (#6B46C1) as primary, with gray (#374151) and white
- Clean, minimal design with good whitespace
- Hover states on all interactive elements
- Tooltips explaining metrics on hover (e.g., "Cost Per Hire = Annual contract value ÷ total influenced hires")
- Dark header with logo placeholder and navigation tabs
- Responsive (works on desktop and tablet)

## Navigation
Tab bar with 3 tabs:
1. Summary (default)
2. Influenced Hires
3. Adoption

## Interactions

- Charts have hover tooltips with exact values
- Export buttons show loading state then success toast

## Bonus (if time permits)
- Add a "Compare Period" toggle to show QoQ change
